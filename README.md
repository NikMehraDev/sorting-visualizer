# Sorting Visualizer

This repository contains a Python terminal application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. Watch as the algorithms sort a list of numbers with colorful, real-time animations.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Shell Sort**

## How It Works

The program generates a list of unique random numbers, displays them with random indentation, and then sorts them using different algorithms. Each sorting step is displayed in the terminal with different colors for visual clarity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- An operating system terminal (supports both Windows and Unix-based systems)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
    cd sorting-visualizer
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python sorting_visualizer.py
    ```

## Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts to visualize different sorting algorithms:
```bash
python sorting_visualizer.py
